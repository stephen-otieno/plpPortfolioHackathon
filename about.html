            <p>Hello! I'm Stephen Otieno Oduor, a passionate and results-driven Software Engineer with a strong focus on
                web development and system programming.
                I specialize in building responsive, accessible, and user-centered applications using technologies like
                HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Django.
                My mission is to create solutions that are not only functional but also meaningful and impactful.
            </p>
            <p> My journey in software engineering is driven by a strong desire to simplify the complex, to automate the
                repetitive, and to build digital tools that create lasting value.

            <p>Over time, I've realized that building software is not just about technologyâ€”it's about people. Every
                application I create is designed with the user in mind, prioritizing clarity, responsiveness, and
                reliability.
                From dynamic websites to system-level tools, I approach every challenge with curiosity and precision,
                always striving to deliver work that I can proudly stand behind.</p>
